Built a real-time chat app using Socket.IO for the backend and React for the frontend. The app allows users to send and receive messages instantly, providing a seamless live messaging experience. This project showcases my ability to integrate WebSocket technology with a modern frontend framework to create an interactive and user-friendly chat application.
